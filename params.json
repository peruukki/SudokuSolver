{"name":"Sudokusolver","body":"This is a simple recursive sudoku solver.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://peruukki.github.com/SudokuSolver/images/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nYou can open sudoku files from File -> Open sudoku. The sample file SampleSudoku.sudoku in the repository root shows the supported format.\r\n\r\nClick Next to advance the solver one step. The solver always tries the first possible options until it cannot go further, in which case it reverts its steps as necessary and tries the next options.\r\n\r\nClick Solve to see the final solution (almost) immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen the solver sets a number in a box, it marks the box with a green border. When the solver enters a 3x3 region where the current number was already set in the beginning, it marks that pre-filled box with a blue border.","tagline":"A recursive sudoku solver. I read about a person who blogged about creating his own sudoku solver but eventually failed because he couldn't get his head around recursion. So I decided to test how I would manage to do it.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
