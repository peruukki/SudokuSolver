This is a simple recursive sudoku solver.

You can open sudoku files from File -> Open sudoku. The sample file SampleSudoku.sudoku in the repository root shows the supported format.

Click Next to advance the solver one step. The solver always tries the first possible options until it cannot go further, in which case it reverts its steps as necessary and tries the next options.

Click Solve to see the final solution (almost) immediately.

When the solver sets a number in a box, it marks the box with a green border. When the solver enters a 3x3 region where the current number was already set in the beginning, it marks that pre-filled box with a blue border.
